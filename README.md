# QAC Quantum Algorithms Practice Labs

Welcome to the QAC Quantum Algorithms Practice Labs! This repository is a collection of various quantum algorithm implementations designed for learning and practice within the QAC Team.

## Overview
In this repository, you will find implementations of fundamental quantum algorithms, including:
- Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm
- Grover’s Algorithm
- Shor’s Algorithm
These algorithms are essential for newcomers to practice and understand the basics of quantum computing.

## How to Use
Feel free to explore each algorithm and try implementing them in your own Jupyter Notebook Environment. Each algorithm notebook (.ipynb) contains:
- Documentation: Summary of the algorithm explanations and step-by-step guides.
- Practice tasks: Sample tasks to help practice and and understand the algorithm and its implementation using Qiskit 1.x

To get started with the quantum algorithms in this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/QuantumAICloud/quantum-algorithms
```
Navigate to the directory:
```
cd quantum-algorithms
```
Follow the instructions in the Jupyter Notebook to run and experiment with the code.
